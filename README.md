# Classic Arcade Game Clone Project

## How to play

You can access the game [here](https://travisfranklin.github.io/FEND-Project3/).  

Your goal is to undertake a journey to the top of the gameboard. You can navigate using your arrow keys. Beware, you must pass many scary creatures on your way. Take heed not to touch them, or your precious vitality will be diminished. Touch one of these creatures three times and you surely shall perish.

When you make a successful journey, your score will increase and you'll be transported back to the start to try again. As your score increases, the creatures will become more difficult to evade.
